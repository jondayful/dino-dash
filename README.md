# Dino Dash
Can you dino-dash and dino-jump through out the game?

# Important
The game has two released application, consisting of a **+60Hz** and and **-60Hz**.

## Likely scenario #1
Oh no! The game is too **fast** when I press '_Space_ to play' and I can't even play properly.
Then **download** [-60Hz](placeholder)

## Likely scenario #2
Oh no! The game is too **slow** when I press '_Space_ to play' and I can't even play properply.
Then **download** [+60Hz](placeholder)

## Why is this happening in the first place?
Due to Godot compatibility with 'delta', the problem occurs from different monitors. Where likely,
some makes the game **too fast** or **too slow**.
